# The dental self assessment
To health care professionals, time is invaluable. 
While chit-chat makes the day tolerable, sometimes there is a desire
to skip the samll talk and get to action. As a dental hygienist, a patients' 
oral care routine is in focus during the visit. 
- By knowing about a patients' routine, desire and special requests before the visit, 
allows the dental professional to plan and execute the treatment faster and better.  

## The application
This is a survey-style application with focus on being simple and effective when gathering 
information and requests from a patient. 
- Name for identification,
- Dropdowns, 
- Radio buttons,
- Check boxes
- Summary 
- and a confirmation. 

## Technologies used
The application is built using React components, JavaScript and CSS and was built
using a mobile-first approach in VScode.
